# Quantum Reality

Life  and consciousness are still a mystery for science and in recent decades we have seen some new insights in understanding the foundational elements of nature.

1. Quantum theory is trying to explain the natures secrets but is still at its inception.

2. Some of the phenomenon still are unexplained by science specially the nature of light in double slit experiment which has raised a greater extent of chaos in science community over the last century. Quantum entanglement is one of the other phenomenon which surprised several scientists including Einstein.

### Double Slit

The double slit experiment in the video below explains clearly about some of the strangest behavior of light.

### Quantum Entanglement
Some arguments/ideas  from the video are criticized and been the subject for last 100 yrs. Some inferences from several people are as " Observation appears to create observed reality", something like reality changes when observer is present. Einstein also noted this as "God does not play dice with universe".

Other mystery is Quantum entanglement, 

Here is a video illustrating the idea of quantum entanglement.<br>

### Thoughts

1. Its like there is another  communication channel in this universe which is instantaneous and  faster than light, contradicting some of Einstein's conclusions. He called it as "Spooky action at a distance".
2. Quantum entanglement has several applications in modern world like quantum computers.

It's really puzzling and scared to know that what we know in this universe is very very minimal.
