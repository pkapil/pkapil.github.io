Understanding life's intricate voodoo is an action item in every generation for human being.Mans ideas fluctuate between righteousness and non-righteous every moment.Righteousness depends on logicality ,morality and legality of the subject.Some things may sound logically correct but may fail being legal or moral ,this could be the same in combinatorial configuration.

Forming a law may happen based on some people's decision in a particular generation by an inclination of morality and a tinge of logicality(may vary case by case). I think morality comes from heart and logicality comes from brain.Hence a proper Law for a generation may change over time.

Ignorant people choose to stick to self identity and be in a trance in idea of loosing their originality when they step into to a new system, in fact they need to understand they stepped in a new system and hence forth they are bound to learn understand and acclimatize to new environment in the new system (This new environment in the new system  is  every moment on this earth which is  resultant of  karma)

Wierd IDeas(Scope for Research):

I had this wierd idea to estimate karma function, im not knowledgeble at this point to even start putting down.But seeding the idea is the inception.

"Understanding the Karma function analyzing it and being able to calculate it."

Rough ideas:  Prarabha karma can be calculated by your horoscope;Sanchitha can be modified by your recent actions: Agamana karma is influenced by prarabha & sanchita karma.Using these clues we can start work towards estimating it...

Life is a learning process & vicious cycle of Karma,Hope my initial step will eventually take me to broader horizons in understanding the purpose of Life.
